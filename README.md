## Branches

The repository has some branches to allow collaboration on a centralized repository, and give everybody the possibility to orient onself. We've two main branches, we use this two to branch from and merge to.

> **The Main Branches Are:**
> -   **main**  _here are  **only**  our well tested releases_
> -   **develop**  _this is the choice for new features during the normal project work_

### Creating Branches

The initial master commit contains the reworked readme.md, .gitignore and .gitattributes files.
Since we donâ€™t use Bitbucket and using GitLab instead, we can no longer create branches out of Jira. No matter what, we still stick to using the **Jira subtask id** as a prefix for the branch names of **feature** and **hotfix** branches.

Here are two examples:
**_feature/FRINST-14-analogvalueprocessing/efro_**  (here is Elias Froschauer working on feature analogvalueprocessing in project FRINST) and
**_hotfix/FRINST-15-analogvalueprocessingbug/toel_** (here is Tino working on a hotfix for the bug in analog value processing after production release). 

### Creating Tags
Every time you finish a task and merge a branch back to the main/master, then you have to fill out the version log here and you've to tag this commit with the prefix ***"version_"*** and the version number.
If you work in a group and the current online version is not the latest master or develop commit, you will need to tag the currently used branch with **"online"**.

## Version-Number-Format

The version number format for this project has following pattern: ***{major release}.{minor release}.{development state}{maintenance}***. Before the software is deployed to the machine, the major number is zero, if the software is deployed and tested 1st time the major number increase to one.

> **Version Number Format Description:**
> -   **major release**  _marks significant changes_
> -   **minor release**  _marks functional extensions or changes_
> -   **development state**  _**a**  is alpha state until start of commissioning (offline phase),  **b**  is beta state in commissioning until internal acceptance (FAT)  **r**  is release candidate from internal acceptance until operational handover (SAT),  **p**  is productive after operational handover_
> -   **maintenance**  _shows the number of patches and hotfixes_

Some examples:
-   **0.0.a0**  _initial commit_
-   **0.3.a7**  _add some features and some bug fixes, software is still in alpha state_
-   **0.3.b9**  _two more bug fixes and the software is now in commissioning beta state_
-   **1.0.r15**  _the software is internally accepted, machine is already running_
-   **1.0.p19**  _we handover the productive machine to customer_

## Contribution

-   The language of software and software comments is **English** and software documentation is **English**
-   Use **branch** and **tag** **rules** as defined earlier
-   If you extend or change the folder structure, then you have to **update this file**
-   You have to provide a **version description** with a small change log for every version tag within this file in the version log section
-   If you want to merge you software to the master branch, then you have to take care that your software is compiling  **without warnings and errors**.
-   If you edit this file you've to do it in **English** and to use the **markdown** format
-	It is **not** allowed to work in the main branches directly
-	It is **only** allowed to work in your own branches (with your ekvip name acronym) or on develop if it's a single source project
-	Every commit to feature or hotfix branch needs to contain the **Jira task id** before the commit description

## Version-Log

> - **version_0.0.a0** All files are suitable for our common Beckhoff projects. They already include specifications for Nexeed too.
